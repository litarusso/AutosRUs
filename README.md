# Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
The variance of MechaCar suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch because of it's design specifications.
We are analising here if data meet this specification for all lots in total and each lot individually.
You can see the results of the analysis at the tables below.
The manufacturing lots meet the specifications because the variance on PSI is 76.

However when we look to all lots, althought  Lot 1 and Lot 2 are meeting the specifications, but Lot 3 doesn't meet the design specification because PSI is 200.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
I did t-tests to find out if all lots together and each lots individually 
### Null Hipotesis
At the images below we see that p values are grater than 0,05 at each lots those are null because all p values are bigger than 0,05, so we cant beleive the outcome.

- _t_(149) = the _t_ statistic, _p_ = _p_ value = 0.06028

- _t_(49) = the _t_ statistic, _p_ = _p_ value = 1
